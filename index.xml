Because you can learn faster, make mistakes, share learning from mistakes, and have a personal impact on those around you. You shape how the company forms.
Why a software studio instead of a product company? It&amp;rsquo;s like spending a few years at a training camp, for something that you love doing :) There should be more companies like ours in Vietnam, even South East Asia, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know many.</description></item><item><title>Ready to push üì©</title><link>https://www.coderpush.com/hello/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 19:32:32 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.coderpush.com/hello/</guid><description>Don&amp;rsquo;t just build features, but design the right product with the right strategy.</description></item><item><title>Purpose, Mission and Values.</title><link>https://www.coderpush.com/purpose/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:47:51 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.coderpush.com/purpose/</guid><description>CoderPush is a purpose-first business, formed to make an impact on our people and clients.
