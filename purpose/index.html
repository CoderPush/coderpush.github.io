We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, targeted training, learning from others, on-the-job experience, and receiving input from others. It is in our DNA as a company and individuals to look for opportunity, stay humble, and never settle. We try to hire people based on their trajectory, not their pedigree.

Respect is a paramount virtue in our culture. Last but not least, honesty is the way we want to grow and feel free. Here’s a lovely quote that captures it:\n Respect should be earned Honestly is always appreciated Trust must be gained Loyalty will be returned  Prioritize People We value lasting relationships among coworkers and with clients. Prioritize people over projects and profit. We encourage one another to speak up whenever we need help. Our team members live across multiple cities and nations, working in different projects from one another. We continuously improve our policies and working procedures so that there are enough options for everyone to be in a productive and comfortable setup to produce wow! work.\nContinuous Delivery A technical definition is best given by continuousdelivery.com,\n Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.\n Inspired by the fantastic The Phoenix Project, we strive to practice Continuous Delivery in software development whenever we can. This includes continuous integration (CI), continuous testing, constant monitoring and pipeline analytics.\nAt CoderPush, we also embrace CI/CD in growing the company and ourselves in personal aspects. We should be empowered to make changes safely, quickly and sustainably. We celebrate healthy habits, such as sports (follow us on Strava), and consistency, such as music or dance.
