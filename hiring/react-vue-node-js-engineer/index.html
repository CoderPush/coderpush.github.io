Yes, similar/better libraries (e.g. svelte, angular, mithril) are also great, and we are good at internal cross-training. The projects available right now are with clients with strong tech, based in Singapore.\nAs a member of the CoderPush team, you will help shape a remote-first workplace with full-timers and part-timers from Saigon, Hanoi, and the US.\nWho we are CoderPush is a studio of engineers and designers who collaborate with clients for great software, teams, and processes.\nWe are a young team, so you can contribute to the client experiences we are creating. Reviews and testimonials are on Clutch.\nWhat youâ€™ll work on We want to be coworkers for years to come, but projects that are available immediately include location-aware recommendations apps, digital signature tools, real-time IoT device dashboards, and online learning class management applications.\nWe are looking for someone with  Good communication skills in English and Vietnamese. Humility to learn what you donâ€™t know, everyday. Ability to understand and define all actions to be performed when assigned to a task. Ability to manage time when facing difficulties or under pressure or deadlines. Codemunication skills. For example, do not have long-lived branches and love updating your PR descriptions for the sake of self and others.  Benefits  Full-time insurances and benefits. Salary $1.5k-3k gross depending on experience. Performance-based bonuses tied to project deliverables. Sponsorships to take part in sports and tech activities.  Office We are remote-first, it means working remotely does not make you less important or boring. But people who love office still get the great office experience. Our humble place is in the beautiful City Garden in Binh Thanh district. We hold weekly video and board games every Friday from 4pm till late â€“ a great time to host friends, clients and job applicants!\nInterested? ðŸ™Œ Loading...   Click here if you prefer a full form!\nPersonal growth Still here? You must be thinking about how youâ€™ll grow. Thatâ€™s one of our core values.\nWhy join a young company instead of a big one? Because you can learn faster, make mistakes, share learning from mistakes, and have personal impact on those around you. You shape how the company forms.\nWhy a software studio instead of a product company? Itâ€™s like spending a few years at a training camp, for something that you love doing :) There should be more companies like ours in Vietnam, even South East Asia, but we donâ€™t know many. And by the way, we build to last, without the pressure of investment capital.\nWhy CoderPush instead of just another firm? Because we build teams first, products second. We have been cofounders of a bilingual school, a coding school, a running club, and a few funded startups (letâ€™s exchange stories!).\nAnd lastly, join to build a company like building great code itself: continuous improvement, continuous deployment, refactoring, technical debt, and finally, contributing to open source.\n","wordCount":"492","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.coderpush.com/js-engineer.png","datePublished":"2021-09-02T22:50:24+07:00","dateModified":"2021-09-02T22:50:24+07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Long"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.coderpush.com/hiring/react-vue-node-js-engineer/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"CoderPush","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.coderpush.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme: #1d1e20;--entry: #2e2e33;--primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg: #2e2e33;--code-bg: #37383e;--border: #333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.coderpush.com/ accesskey=h title="(Alt + H)"><img src=/logo.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=40></a>
