It means you are encouraged to work from anywhere that you enjoy the most. Whenever you feel like you need some human interaction, our crew in H√† N·ªôi, Hu·∫ø, S√†i G√≤n and other cities will be happy seeing you!\nWho we are CoderPush is a studio of engineers and designers who collaborate with clients for great software, teams, and processes.\nWe set a very high expectation on client satisfaction for the long term. See reviews on Clutch.\nWhat you‚Äôll work on We want to be coworkers for years to come, and you need to learn new tech. However, in the short term, here are things you can do:\n Help make Rails apps with high traffic to be more performant on AWS. Be familiar with setting up ElastiCache (Redis, Memcached), ElasticSearch, load balancing (ECS, RDS) and so on. Contribute to maintaining our self-hosted open-source applications, such as Mattermost (Slack alternative). Learn, practice, taking exam and become an AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional!  PS: too easy? We‚Äôve got teams using other backends (e.g. Python, Node, Elixir) as well as frontend (mostly React ecosystem).\nPS2: Why AWS you may ask? While we can (and did) work with projects on AWS, GCP and others, we decided to go all-in on AWS. Because you know, one can do anything but not everything! We prefer to be excellent in one focused expertise rather than being average on everything!\nWe are looking for someone with  2 years of experiences. Familiar with AWS is a plus! Good communication skills in English and Vietnamese. Humility to learn and share what you don‚Äôt know, everyday. Ability to understand and define all actions to be performed when assigned to a task. Ability to manage time when facing difficulties, under pressure or deadlines. Codemunication skills. For example, as a DevOps, it means loving ‚Äúinfrastructure as code‚Äù and ‚Äúdiagram as code‚Äù.  Curiosity and patience in DevOpSec practice. For example, some will find this summary shared by our coworkerboring, but you love it and want to add more to it.\nBenefits  Salary $1.5k-$2k gross depending on experience. Performance-based bonuses tied to project deliverables. Sponsorships to get learning resources and taking exam for your AWS certification. Full-time insurances and benefits. Sponsorships to take part in sports and tech activities.  Office We are remote-first, it means working remotely does not make you less important or boring. But people who love office still get a great office experience. Our humble place is in the beautiful City Garden in Binh Thanh district. We hold weekly video and board games every Friday from 4pm till late ‚Äì a great time to host friends, clients and job applicants!\nInterested? üôå Loading...   Click here if you prefer a full form!\nPersonal growth Still here? You must be thinking about how you‚Äôll grow. That‚Äôs one of our core values.\nWhy join a young company instead of a big one? Because you can learn faster, make mistakes, share learning from mistakes, and have personal impact on those around you. You shape how the company forms.\nWhy a software studio instead of a product company? You do not get stuck in a product or a product team. You get coaching and mentorship not from only your project team but from other project teams as well. We build to last, without the pressure of investment capital.\nWhy CoderPush instead of just another ‚Äúdevshop‚Äù? Because we build teams first, products second. We have been cofounders of a bilingual school, a coding school, a running club, and a few funded startups (let‚Äôs exchange stories!).\nAnd lastly, join to build a company like building great code itself: continuous improvement, continuous deployment, refactoring, technical debt, and contributing to open source.\n","wordCount":"648","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.coderpush.com/devops-skills.png","datePublished":"2021-09-01T22:50:24+07:00","dateModified":"2021-09-01T22:50:24+07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Harley"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.coderpush.com/hiring/devops-engineer/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"CoderPush","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.coderpush.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme: #1d1e20;--entry: #2e2e33;--primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg: #2e2e33;--code-bg: #37383e;--border: #333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.coderpush.com/ accesskey=h title="(Alt + H)"><img src=/logo.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=40></a>
